## About

This is a software package designed to model the kinetics of aerosols under various conditions.

This is not intended as a black box: we tried to keep the python code as simple as possible so the user can see how the model is implemented. No knowledge of python is needed to actually use the model through the GUI, however with a little python experience it _should_ be straightforward to extend the model (by e.g. introducing new solutions) or automate running simulations over a range of conditions.

This package implements a standard theoretical model of aerosol drying described in the following literature:

* Liu _et al_, "Evaporation and dispersion of respiratory droplets from coughing", Indoor Air 27(1), 179-180 (2017). DOI: 10.1111/ina.12297

* Dan Hardy (dan.hardy@bristol.ac.uk)

Elements of the code were inspired by a numerical model built by Jim Walker (jim.walker@bristol.ac.uk).
